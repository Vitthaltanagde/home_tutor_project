  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-600">These Terms & Conditions govern your use of the GuruGO platform. By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by these terms.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2 text-blue-700">1. Role of GuruGO</h2>
  <p>GuruGO is an intermediary platform that connects students/parents with independent tutors. We do not employ, endorse, or directly manage any tutor listed on our website. Our role is strictly limited to providing an online space for tutor-student matching.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2 text-blue-700">2. No Guarantees or Warranties</h2>
  <p>GuruGO does not guarantee the quality, behavior, availability, or results of any tutor. We do not offer academic guarantees or performance guarantees of any kind. Users must evaluate tutors independently before engagement.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2 text-blue-700">3. Background Checks</h2>
  <p>GuruGO does not perform criminal background checks, identity verification, or academic certificate validation. Parents and students are responsible for conducting their own due diligence before hiring any tutor.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2 text-blue-700">4. Payments and Refunds</h2>
  <p>GuruGO is not liable for any payments made between tutors and students. All financial transactions are to be handled directly between the tutor and the parent/student. We do not provide refunds or intervene in payment disputes.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2 text-blue-700">5. Code of Conduct</h2>
  <p>All users of the platform (students, parents, tutors) must act respectfully and professionally. Any form of harassment, abuse, or inappropriate behavior may result in account suspension or permanent ban from the platform.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2 text-blue-700">6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>GuruGO shall not be held liable for any damages, losses, injuries, or disputes arising out of any interaction, communication, or transaction between users of the platform. Use the service at your own risk.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2 text-blue-700">7. Termination</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any user account at any time, without prior notice, if we believe the user has violated any part of these terms or engaged in any unlawful activity.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2 text-blue-700">8. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All content, design, logos, and trademarks on the GuruGO website are the property of GuruGO and may not be used or reproduced without permission.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2 text-blue-700">9. Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>In the event of any dispute, users agree to first contact GuruGO support for resolution. If a mutual agreement cannot be reached, the matter will be governed under the jurisdiction of Pune, Maharashtra, India.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2 text-blue-700">10. Escape Clause</h2>
  <p>In case any provision of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. This ensures our platform remains protected even if one part is challenged or invalidated.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2 text-blue-700">11. Updates to Terms</h2>
  <p>GuruGO reserves the right to update or modify these Terms & Conditions at any time. Continued use of the platform after changes indicates acceptance of those changes.</p>
